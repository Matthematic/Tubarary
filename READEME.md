Stratego:

Objective
The object of the game is to capture your opponent's flag.


Gameplay:
You and your opponent alternate turns. The red player moves first.
On your turn you can do one of the following:
Move -- one of your playing pieces to an open adjacent space.
Or Attack -- one of your opponent's playing pieces.


Moving Pieces
1. Pieces move one square at a time, forward, backward or sideways. (Exception: see Special Scout Privilege, Rule 6).
2. Pieces cannot move diagonally. They cannot jump over another piece. They cannot move onto a square already occupied by another piece (unless attacking).
3. Pieces cannot jump over or move onto the two areas in the center of the gameboard that are indicated by the dotted lines. See Figure 1.
4. A piece cannot move back and forth between the same two squares in three consecutive turns.
5. Only one piece can be moved on a turn.
6. Special Scout Privilege: A Scout can move any number of open squares forward, backward, or sideways. But remember, this movement will let your opponent
    know the value of that piece. You may wish to move your Scouts one space at a time to confuse your opponent. Scouts are the only pieces allowed to
    move and attack on the same turn. See Rules For Attack, below.
Remember, the Bomb and Flag pieces cannot be moved and must remain on the squares where they were originally placed throughout the game.


Each side gets the following pieces:
Moveable Pieces:
    1 Marshal
    1 General
    2 Colonels
    3 Majors
    4 Captains
    4 Lieutenants
    5 Sergeants
    5 Miners
    6 Scouts
    1 Spy

Non-Moveable Pieces:
    6 Bombs
    1 Flag


Attacking Pieces
1. Attack Position: When a red and blue piece occupy adjacent spaces either back to back, side to side, or face to face, they are in a position to attack.

2. How To Attack: To attack on your turn, take your attacking piece and lightly tap your opponent's piece. Then, declare the rank of your attacking piece. Your opponent then declares the rank of his/her defending piece.
3. The piece with the lower rank (and lower number) is captured and removed from the board. If your piece (the attacking piece) is the remaining and winning piece, it moves into the space formerly occupied by the defending piece. If the remaining and winning piece is the defending piece, it stays on the square it was in when it was attacked.
4. When pieces of the same rank battle, both pieces are removed from the game.
5. Attacking is always optional.

Rank
1. A Marshal (Number 10) outranks a General (Number 9) and any other lower-ranking piece.
A General (Number 9) outranks a Colonel (Number 8) and any lower-ranking (but higher numbered) piece.
A Colonel (Number 8) outranks a Major (Number 7) and so on down to the Spy which is the lowest-ranking piece.
2. Special Miner Privilege. When any piece (except a Miner - ranked 3) strikes a Bomb, that piece is lost and removed from the board. When a Miner strikes a Bomb, the Bomb is defused and removed from the gameboard. The Miner then moves into the Bomb's space on the board. Bombs remain on the same square throughout the game unless they are defused. Bombs cannot attack or move.
3. Special Spy Privilege. A Spy has no numeral rank. If any piece attacks it, it is captured and removed from the board. But the Spy has a unique attacking privilege. It is the only piece that can outrank a Marshal providing the Spy attacks the Marshal first. If the Marshal attacks first then the Spy is removed.


Strategy Hints
1. Place Bombs around the Flag to protect it. But place a Bomb or two elsewhere to confuse your opponent.

2. Put a few high-ranking pieces in the front line, but be careful! If you lose them early in the game you're in a weak position.
3. Scouts should be in the front lines to help you discover the strength of opposing pieces.
4. Place some Miners in the rear for the end of the game, where they will be needed to defuse Bombs.


End of the Game
The first player to attack an opponent's Flag captures it and wins the game.
If all of your moveable pieces have been removed and you cannot move or attack on a turn, you must give up and declare your opponent the winner.
